      After peppering Mr. Robertson with questions, Mr. Hsieh was convinced.
      Zappos would go Holacratic. The transformation began in 2013 in certain
      departments, but only in recent months has the entire company taken the
      plunge. Nothing about Holacracy is easy to understand. In place of a
      traditional organizational chart are concentric circles of responsibility.

  Idea in Brief The Hype Holacracy and other forms of self-organization have
  been getting a lot of press. Proponents hail them as "flat" environments that
  foster flexibility, engagement, productivity, and efficiency. Critics say
  they're naive, unrealistic experiments. The Reality Neither view is quite
  right.
