Daring Leadership

Excerpt from Talk by Bren√© Brown

\* You will get your a$$ kicked.

\* You will show up even when you cannot control the outcome.

\* If you are not in the arena occasionally getting your a$$ kicked, you don't need to give me advice.

\* The arena is surrounded by individuals in cheap seats giving advice to those of us in the arena.

\* Your boundaries are your values.

\* The only thing you can take into the arena is your clarity of values.

\* Your clarity of values determines your boundaries.

\* When you cross the threshold into the arena strip away your armor and put down your weapons so you can have a clear mind when you connect with others in the arena.
